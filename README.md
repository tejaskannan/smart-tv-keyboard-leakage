# Smart TV Acoustic Keystroke Leakage
This repository contains the code for discovering keystrokes from the audio of Apple and Samsung Smart TVs.

## Overview
This repository has two main portions: audio extraction and string recovery. The phases are split for checkpointing reasons. The audio extraction module is written in Python, and the string recovery is in Java. The folder `audio` contains most of the code related to audio extraction. The directory `search` holds the Java code involving string recovery.
